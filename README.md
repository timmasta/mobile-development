# mobile-development
Repo to store my mobile development course project and other assignments.
These projects are developed for use with Jquery on mobile browsers.

My course project is a web page that displays a list of favorite all time songs. 
The page is themed using ThemeRoller and heavily utilizes Jquery. 

The home page is tim-home.html and the URL to view it on the SOTD website is:
