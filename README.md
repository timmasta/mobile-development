# mobile-development
Repo to store my mobile development course project and other assignments.
These projects are developed for use with Jquery on mobile browsers.

My course project is a web page that displays a list of favorite all time songs. 
The page is themed using ThemeRoller and heavily utilizes Jquery. 

The home page is tim-home.html and the URL to view it on the SOTD website is:
http://sotd.us/timothymastarone/mobile-development/course-project/tim-home.html

All of the html is one a single page. The 'page' data attribute is used to separate pages.
The main page conatains several links to other pages. 

There is a useful panel to either view a list of songs or add new ones.

All of my css rules are in 'styles/tim-styles.css'.
The css generated by ThemeRoller in in the 'themes' directory.
